Easily add event listing with an Add to Calendar button to your website.

== Description ==

Sometimes you don't need _a whole event system plugin_ but just a way to add event listings to your website with a handy Add to Calendar link! This block let's you easily add event listings with names, date/time, an image, a small description, and a handy Add to Calendar link to add events to your Calendar.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `event-block` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or search for `Event Block` from the Block Library in your WordPress installation
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress if you installed through the plugin repository.
3. Add the Event Block to your website and edit away!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I style the Event block differently? =

All styles use the `.wp-block-createwithrani-event-block` selector, use that to override any styles you'd like! But preferably use a custom class that you add to do so.

== Screenshots ==

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
